<p>I had registered for a git account before, so I'll keep using it. </p>
<p>If I think back about my use of git with my co-workers, I would not say we did a good job on it...We always got terrified when we have to merge, or we found we modified the same lines at the same time.</p>
However, I found this <a href="http://ife.baidu.com/note/list?isElite=1&courseId=1&orderBy=approveCount
">article</a> very helpful in helping me understand git better. Many many thanks.

<p>My git account is xrlu0929. I created a repo for this learning session at IFE. Let enjoy it!</p>
